# shinyHistologyQC
App summarises changes in versions of metadata by providing summary statistics and change logs compared to a previous release of the metadata. In addition, users can also generate pdf reports to capture change in values per column to review ( and update downstream analysis and reduce any surprise code breaks!).

For OpenPBTA we also provide `CNS_region`,`broad_histology` and `short_histology` assignment to the metadata.

Typical use case:
A new metadata file is generated
  - ðŸ—‚ you want to compare to a previous file for an on-going project
  - ðŸ”– identify and capture the changes 
  - âœ… fix any discrepancies.
